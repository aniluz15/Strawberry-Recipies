        <p>Ingredients:

               ♡3/4 cup King Arthur Gluten-Free Multipurpose Flour
               ♡1/4 cup cornstarch
               ♡3/4 cup Baker’s Sugar (superfine sugar)
               ♡1/2 cups egg whites
               ♡1/4 teaspoon salt
               ♡1 ½ teaspoons cream of tartar
               ♡2 teaspoons vanilla extract
               ♡1/4 teaspoon almond extract
               ♡3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons Baker’s Sugar (superfine sugar) </p>
               Directions:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and make sure that your oven rack in its lowest position.
Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, and 3/4 cup sugar and set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat together the egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar until foamy.
Add the vanilla and almond extracts.
Gradually increase the speed of the mixer and continue beating until the egg whites have increased in volume, and thickened.
With the mixer still running, slowly add the in the 3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar in batches (I used a 1/8 measure), until the meringue holds soft peaks.
Turn the mixer speed to low and add in the flour/sugar/cornstarch blend ¼ cup at a time until just incorporated.
Spoon the batter into an ungreased 10″ round angel food cake pan.
Gently tap the pan on the counter to settle the batter and remove any large air bubbles.
Bake the cake for 40-45 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until it is a deep golden brown and it has started to pull away from the sides.
Remove the cake from the oven and (while it is still hot) invert the pan onto the neck of a heatproof bottle or funnel, to suspend the cake upside down as it sets and cools, about 2 hours. (I actually skipped this part and cooled it right side up because in Max and Ruby, Ruby’s cake always looks a little lopsided and deflated… it won’t affect the taste, but the cake won’t be quite as fluffy).
After the cake has cooled completely, remove the cake from the pan by running a thin spatula or knife around the edges of the pan, and turning the cake out onto a plate.
Either eat the cake as is or frost with your favorite frosting.
