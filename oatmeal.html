                Needed: 
                        ♡Ice Cream Maker
                        ♡Blender
                        </p>
            
            <p> First, put the Cream Cheese, Milk, Heavy Cream, Vanilla Extract, Lemon Zest, Sugar and salt into the blender. Blend until the chunks of cream cheese is fully dissolved. Then Grab 
            the blender and put it into the ice cream cylinder. Make sure to put that in first and turn it on letting it spin BEFORE you put the ice and ice cream salt on the sides. Keep the Ice Cream spinning for around 30-45 minutes and at about 20 minutes in add in the strawberry puree then
            grab your cup and dice a strawberry into fourths placing it on the bottom sides of the cup. Once the ice cream is finished, layer the ice cream ontop of the diced strawberries add a thin layer of whip cream ontop of the ice cream add diced strawberries and gram cracker crums and repeat the process again starting with the ice cream until the cup is full. Add a tower of whip cream and a pretty strawberry on top. </p>
